# 📈 Stock Market Price Predictor

This project uses deep learning to predict stock prices and visualize historical trends. It includes two main components:

* **Model training** using historical stock price data.
* **Streamlit web app** to input any stock symbol (e.g., `GOOG`) and view price trends and predictions.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python, NumPy, Pandas
* Keras / TensorFlow
* scikit-learn
* yfinance (data fetching)
* Matplotlib
* Streamlit (interactive frontend)

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 📥 Fetches real-time stock data via **Yahoo Finance**
* 🧾 Shows historical data and moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200)
* 📊 Predicts future stock prices using a deep learning model
* 📺 Visual comparison between **Predicted vs Original** prices
* 📌 Intuitive and interactive **Streamlit interface**

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-predictor.git
   cd stock-market-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure model file exists**
   Update `app.py` with your trained `.keras` model path.

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
